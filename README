Thanks to NVIDIA, my demo is a copy of deepstream's.

Prequisites:

Please follow instructions in the apps/deepstream-app/README on how to install
the prequisites for Deepstream SDK, the DeepStream SDK itself and the apps.

Compilation Steps:
  $ cd source/
  $ make
  $ ./deepstream_demo <h264_elementary_stream>

This document shall describe about the sample deepstream-test1 application.

It is meant for simple demonstration of how to use the various DeepStream SDK
elements in the pipeline and extract meaningful insights from a video stream.

This sample creates instance of "nvinfer" element. Instance of
the "nvinfer" uses TensorRT API to execute inferencing on a model. Using a
correct configuration for a nvinfer element instance is therefore very
important as considerable behaviors of the instance are parameterized
through these configs.
 
nvinfer element attach some MetaData to the buffer. By attaching
the probe function at the end of the pipeline, one can extract meaningful
information from this inference. Please refer the "osd_sink_pad_buffer_probe"
function in the sample code. For details on the Metadata format, refer to the
file "gstnvdsmeta.h"
